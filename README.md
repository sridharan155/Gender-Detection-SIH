# Gender Detection from Facial Images using CNN

This project is a deep learning-based application that detects and classifies **gender** (Male/Female) from facial images. It also counts and displays the total number of males and females detected in real-time using **OpenCV** and a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**.


🧠 Project Overview

With the help of CNN and facial recognition, this project aims to automate gender classification from images or webcam video streams. It is trained on a dataset containing labeled facial images and works with both static images and live feeds.


✨ Features

- ✅ Real-time gender detection using webcam
- ✅ Supports static image-based prediction
- ✅ Displays count of detected **Males** and **Females**
- ✅ High accuracy with a lightweight CNN model
- ✅ Easy to integrate and deploy


🗃️ Dataset Used

- Dataset: **UTKFace** / Custom Labeled Dataset
- 2,000+ facial images with gender labels
- Includes various age groups, ethnicities, and lighting conditions
